# 1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

# print 2
# print 4
# print 6
# print 8
# print 10
# print Goodbye!

# num = 1 
# while num <11:
#     if num %2 == 0:
#         print (num)
#     num += 1

# print ("Goodbye!")

# 2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

# print Hello!
# print 10
# print 8
# print 6
# print 4
# print 2

# print ('Hello!')
# num = 11
# while num != 1:
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#         print(num)
#     num -= 1

# 3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

# 21
# which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

# For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable end. Our automating testing will provide a value of end for you - so write your code in the following box assuming end is already defined.

# end = 6
# sum = 0
# while end != 0:
#     sum = sum + end
#     end -= 1
# print(sum)
